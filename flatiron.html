            <h2>The Flatiron School</h2>
            <p>The school is an intensive 3 month, full-time course that trains students to become full-stack web developers. The program starts with programming fundamentals and culminates in advanced concepts in Ruby and JavaScript. The school not only teaches web development but also teaches us the history of web development including the contributions of people like Ada Lovelace or Grace Hopper. We also keep a <a class="inbut" href="http://hannahlw.github.io/" target="_blank">technical blog</a> while at the school, create our own web applications and present our work at a meetup.</p>
